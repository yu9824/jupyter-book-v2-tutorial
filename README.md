? What would you like to call the action? deploy.yml

🎉 GitHub Action is configured:

.github/workflows/deploy.yml

✅ Next Steps

    https://github.com/yu9824/jupyter-book-v2-tutorial/settings/pages

2. Enable GitHub Pages
3. Use GitHub Actions as the source
4. Push these changes (and/or merge to main)
5. Look for a new action to start

    https://github.com/yu9824/jupyter-book-v2-tutorial/actions

6. Once the action completes, your site should be deployed at:

    https://yu9824.github.io/jupyter-book-v2-tutorial

7. 🎉 Celebrate and tell us about your site on BlueSky or Mastodon! 🐦 🐘

## Root Page

The “root” of a site is the page displayed when someone browses to the index of your site without any pathname. The CLI will choose the root file in the following order:

1. index.md / README.md / main.md
2. index.tex / README.tex / main.tex
3. index.ipynb / README.ipynb / main.ipynb
4. The first .md file found alphabetically
5. The first .tex file found alphabetically
6. The first .ipynb file found alphabetically
